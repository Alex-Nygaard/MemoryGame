# Memory Game
#### -> Class project created by Alexander Nyg√•rd and Laurens Michielsen

## Description
This is a in-class project for the Web and Database Technology (WDT) course taught at TU Delft for the year 2021-22. The project is for extra credits with a timeline of a maximum of 4 weeks. The final product was evaluated by a teachers assistant and consituted a passing grade (the assignment was pass/fail).

Our product implements a memory game, in which users compete against eachother to get the most correct pairs of images. As requested by the client, the game employs a TU Delft and Netherlands theme, consistently using the TU Delft color scheme and showing typical Dutch-inspired cultural images.

The game uses a pure JS, HTML and CSS frontend combined with a Node.js backend. As specified by the client, no database integration was required.
